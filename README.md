# Understanding Yelp Reviews Through Text Mining

This repository contains the final project for my *Text Mining* course in the Master‚Äôs in Computational Social Science (UC3M): **Analyzing Yelp Restaurant Reviews with Text Mining**. It includes all relevant code, the R Markdown report, and the sample dataset used to generate sentiment tags and quick-take summaries from Yelp reviews.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project uses a subset of Yelp data prepared for class use. Results reflect only this limited sample and are not representative of the full Yelp dataset.

## Project structure

This repository includes the following files:

- `yelp_text_mining.html`: The rendered HTML version of the final report.
  - üìÑ **Open this file to explore the results without running any code.**
- `yelp_text_mining.Rmd`: The main R Markdown script with code, analysis, and output.
- `yelp_sampled_reviews.csv`: A small sample of Yelp reviews used for the analysis.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Clone or download the repository as a `.zip` file.
2. Open the `text-mining-final.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. Knit `yelp_text_mining.Rmd` to HTML.

All necessary packages and data are self-contained within the project folder. If needed, install missing packages before running.
